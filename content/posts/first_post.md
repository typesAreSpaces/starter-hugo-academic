While building this website, I thought it would be convenient (at least for me) to document the process. Most of this material is taken from [this post](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/post/migrating/). In fact, I was able to accomplish the resulting website thanks to it, but I believe there are a couple of things the author forgot to mention which could have been more useful. I hope this note helps others to find it useful as well as me.
