While building this website, I thought it would be convenient to take some notes
of the process. Most of this material is taken from [this post](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/post/migrating/). I was able to
accomplish the resulting website thanks to it, but I believe there are a couple
of things the author forgot to mention or simply the [academic theme](https://academic-demo.netlify.app) has updated
which are not mentioned in the original post. I hope this note helps others
building their website using the [Hugo Academic theme](https://academic-demo.netlify.app).
