\section{Personal Statement}

My research interest lies in the intersection of
logic in computer science and algebraic methods,
specifically in designing and applying algebraic tools
for program verification. Additionally, I have found a recent
passion for security properties of programming languages and
the implemetation of the latter by using formal methods.
