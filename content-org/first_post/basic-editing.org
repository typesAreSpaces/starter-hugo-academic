*** Basic customization

It can definitely take some time to go through the documentation to figure out where to make the necessary changes to have a working ready-to-publish personal website. The following is a list of the places a user might be interested in checking for the latter:

**** Navigation links:
***** Check ./config/_default/menus.yaml
***** Add the option `canonifyURLS: true` otherwise the page header doesn't link to the right home page.

**** Footer (./config/_default/params.yaml):
***** appearance section (where to store themes)
***** footer section (replace Me by Author's name)
