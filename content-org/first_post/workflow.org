*** Workflow

**** Add a publication
As mentioned before, I noticed two mechanisms to add publications into your academic themed website according to the official [[https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/][documentation.]] The default directory for making changes about is ~$WEBSITE_PATH/content/publication~. In my case, I decided to change a bit the format and rearrange the structure a little bit. In any case, the following should be useful whether you continue using the default settings or decide to make changes.

***** Manual

For each publication, it requires a named directory, call it ~A~, inside ~$WEBSITE_PATH/content/publication/~

The content for ~$WEBSITE_PATH/content/publication/A/~ should contain the following:

- cite.bib: Basically it contains the information you would like to provide for your paper to be included into a bibtex library, i.e. like an entry for a bibtex file in a \(\LaTeX\) document.
- index.md: TODO

***** Using the python package academic

TODO

You can install it with the following command:

#+begin_src bash 
pip3 install -U academic
#+end_src

To do a massive migration:

#+begin_src bash 
academic import --bibtex data/publications.bib
#+end_src
