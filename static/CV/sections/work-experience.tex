\section{Work Experience}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Principal RSDE Mark Marron).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I developed a prototype of the verification engine for the Bosque programming language in $F^{*}$. 
      \item Bosque is a language that does not implement loops but offers to programmers transformers
        and functional programming constructions (limited fold operation) to do their programming tasks.
    \end{itemize}

  %\item Research Student, Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences. 2018 

  \item Research Student, Universidad de las Americas Puebla (Advisor: Prof. Mauricio
    Osorio). 2015 - 2017. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Collaboration with a group or researchers on Paraconsistent
        Logics. 
      \item My activities included working on some theorems and generate models using
        the answer set solver Clasp.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Intern, Universidad de las Americas Puebla (Advisor: Prof. Ofelia
    Cervantes Gutierrez). 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I worked and analysed graph algorithms to
        compute Freeman centralities for the development of a recommendation
        system.
    \end{itemize}
