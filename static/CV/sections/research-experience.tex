\section{Research Experience}

\begin{itemize}
\item Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Principal RSDE Mark Marron).
  I developed a prototype of the verification engine for the Bosque programming language in $F^{*}$.
  Bosque is a language that does not implement loops but offers to programmers transformers
  and functional programming constructions (limited fold operation) to do their programming tasks.
\item Master Thesis, University of New Mexico (Advisor: Prof. Deepak Kapur).
  Implementation of Novel Interpolation Algorithms for EUF and Octagonal Formulas.
\item Research Student, Universidad de las Americas Puebla (Advisor: Prof. Mauricio
  Osorio). 2015 - 2017. Collaboration with a group or researchers on Paraconsistent
  Logics. My activities included working on some theorems and generate models using
  the answer set solver Clasp.
\item Undergraduate Thesis, Universidad de las Americas (Advisor: Prof.
  Mauricio Osorio). Fall 2005. Revisiting $C_1$.
